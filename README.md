# atypical_todo_list

A new Flutter project. My new book Flutter Guide will use this code repository and others as well.

In this repository we will take inputs from text fields and add our todo list.

Fairly simple, but it will help readers to learn more about Flutter layouts and state management.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
